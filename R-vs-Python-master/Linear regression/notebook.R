#' #### Foreword ####
#' 
#' My friend Randy Olson and I got into the habit to argue about the relative 
#' qualities of our favorite languages for data analysis and visualization. I am
#' an enthusiastic R user ([www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)) while 
#' Randy is a fan of Python ([www.python.org](http://www.python.org)). One thing
#' we agree on however is that our discussions are meaningless unless we
#' actually put R and Python to a series of tests to showcase their relative
#' strengths and weaknesses. Essentially we will set a common goal (*e.g.*,
#' perform a particular type of data analysis or draw a particular type of
#' graph) and create the R and Python codes to achieve this goal. And since
#' Randy and I are all about sharing, open source and open access, we decided to
#' make public the results of our friendly challenges so that you can help us
#' decide between R and Python and, hopefully, also learn something along the
#' way.

#' #### Today's challenge: walk the line ####
#' 
#' ##### 1 - Introduction #####
#' 
#' Linear regression is one of the most popular statistical tools, in particular
#' when it comes to detect and measure the strength of trends in time-series 
#' (but not only). Today we will show you how to perform a linear regression in 
#' R and Python, how to run basic diagnostic tests to make sure the linear 
#' regression went well, and how to nicely plot the final result.
#' 
#' The data we will use today are provided by [Quandl](http://www.quandl.com/). 
#' Quandl is a company that collects and organizes time-series datasets from 
#' hundred's of public sources, and can even host your datasets for free. It is 
#' like the YouTube of time-series data. Besides having a huge collection of 
#' datasets, the nice thing about Quandl is that it provides packages for 
#' [R](http://www.quandl.com/help/packages/r) and 
#' [Python](http://www.quandl.com/help/packages/python) (and [other languages as
#' well](http://www.quandl.com/help/packages)) that make it very easy - one line
#' of code! - to retrieve time-series datasets directly from your favorite data 
#' analysis tool. Yeah Quandl!
#' 
#' The dataset that we will explore contains information about the average 
#' contributions of individuals and corporations to the income taxes, expressed
#' as a fraction of the [Gross Domestic Produce 
#' (GDP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product). We will use 
#' linear regression to estimate the variation of these contributions from 1945 
#' to 2013.
#' 
#' In the following, we will detail the different steps of the process and 
#' provide for each step the corresponding code (red boxes for R, green boxes 
#' for Python). You will also find the entire codes at the end of this document.
#' 
#' If you think thereâ€™s a better way to code this in either language, leave a 
#' pull request on our [GitHub 
#' repository](https://github.com/morpionZ/R-vs-Python/tree/master/Deadliest%20movies%20scrape/code)
#' or leave a note with suggestions in the comments below.
#' 


#' ##### 2 - Step by step process #####
#' 
#' First things first, let's set up our working environment by loading some
#' necessary libraries.

#+ libR, message=FALSE
# Load libraries
require("Quandl")         # Functions to access Quandl's database
require("lattice")        # Base graph functions

import Quandl

#' Now, let's load the dataset from Quandl. You can find it on Quandl's website 
#' [here](http://www.quandl.com/TPC/HIST_RECEIPT-Historical-Source-of-Revenue-as-Share-of-GDP).
#' Among other things, this dataset contains the contributions of individuals 
#' and corporations to the income taxes, expressed as a fraction of the GDP. Its
#' original source is the [Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/).
#' The dataset code at Quandl is "TPC/HIST_RECEIPT" and we will retrieve data
#' from December 31, 1945, to December 31, 2013.
#' 

#+ dataR, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"
# Load data from Quandl

#' The column names from Quandl's data frame contain spaces. We need to correct 
#' that before we can proceed with the rest of the analysis.

#' The dataset contains three columns of interest for us: individuals' and

#' 

#' The first thing one can notice in this graph is the clear decreasing trend of
#' the corporations' income taxes: since 1945, they have dropped from about 7\% 
#' of the GDP to less than 2\%. On the contrary, the individuals' contribution 
#' to the income taxes seems to have remained stable around 8\% of the GDP, with
#' maybe a slight general increase over time. Also there seems to be correlated 
#' fluctuations, with several successive years of increase or decrease probably 
#' due to the prolonged action of successive governments. The intensity of 
#' these fluctuations seems uneven along the considered time period. Finally the
#' corporations' income taxes seem to decrease linearly (more or less) until the
#' mid-80's but do not seem to change much after that. These three elements 
#' (autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity and change in slope) will certainly 
#' raise flags in diagnostic tests but we will deal with them in another
#' challenge. Today we want to focus on making and plotting simple linear 
#' regressions instead.
#' 
#' First, let's fit a linear model to the individual and corporation income 
#' taxes data.
#' 

#+ modelFitIndR, message=FALSE
# Fit individuals' income taxes data
model.ind <- lm(Individual.Income.Taxes ~ Fiscal.Year, data = my.data)

# Fit corporations' income taxes data
model.corp <- lm(Corporation.Income.Taxes ~ Fiscal.Year, data = my.data)

#+ modelFitIndPy, eval=FALSE, engine="python"
# Fit a linear regression to the individual income taxes time series
individual_regression = sm.OLS.from_formula("Individual_Income_Taxes ~ Fiscal_Year", quandl_data).fit()

# Fit a linear regression to the corporation income taxes time series
corporation_regression = sm.OLS.from_formula("Corporation_Income_Taxes ~ Fiscal_Year", quandl_data).fit()

#' Now let's have a look to the summary statistics of each fitted model. We will
#' display the R output only to keep things simple. However if you decide to 
#' look at the Python output, the result of the regression might look a bit 
#' different. Randy had to transform the dates into years because the fitting
#' function did not seem capable of handling dates like the fitting function in
#' R does (it converts the dates in days in this case).
#' 

#' First, the model for individuals' income taxes:
#' 

#+ sumStatsIndR, message=FALSE
# Summary statistics for individual income taxes model
summary(model.ind)

#+ sumStatsIndPy, eval=FALSE, engine="python"
print individual_regression.summary()

#' Then, the model for corporations' income taxes:
#' 

#+ sumStatsCorpR, message=FALSE
# Summary statistics for corporation income taxes model
summary(model.corp)

#+ sumStatsCorpPy, eval=FALSE, engine="python"
print corporation_regression.summary()

#' What do we see? For the individual income taxes, we see a small, positive 
#' increase of +2.579e-05\% of GDP per day (R treats dates as days). Over the 
#' whole 1945 to 2013 period, this corresponds to a total increase of +0.64\% of
#' GDP, *i.e.* a +8.4\% global increase in the contribution of individuals to 
#' income taxes. However this increase is only marginally significant (p = 
#' 0.0575), therefore we can consider that the contribution of individuals to 
#' the income taxes has remained fairly stable during the 7 decades since WWII.
#' 
#' We have a very different story for the corporation income taxes. The linear 
#' model shows a strongly significant (p < 2e-16) decrease of -1.564e-04\% of 
#' GDP per day. Over the 1945-2013 period, this corresponds to a total decrease 
#' of -3.88\% of GDP, *i.e.* a -80.1\% global decrease in the contribution of 
#' corporations to income taxes.
#' 
#' Of course, we need to be very cautious in the interpretation of these results
#' because the linear models we have fitted to the data do not take into account
#' the potential sources of error that we have identified earlier. We will see 
#' next time how we can evaluate them, and correct them if necessary.
#' 
#' For now, we will assume that everything is good and we will focus on plotting
#' the two linear models and their confidence interval over the data.
#' 
#' To do this, we will first compute the value and confidence interval as
#' predicted by each model for different dates. We will choose dates that cover
#' the whole studied period (1945-2013), plus a little extra on both ends (10\%)
#' to make the graph more aesthetically pleasing (*i.e.*, the models'
#' predictions will cover a larger time period than the x-axis limits of the
#' graph). 
#' 

#+ predictR, message=FALSE
# Create new dates for model predictions
difference <- as.Date("2013-12-31") - as.Date("1945-12-31")

                                       interval = "confidence"))
})
