    "# Regularisation for Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation is a technique commonly used in Machine Learning to prevent overfitting. It consists on adding terms to the objective function such that the optimisation procedure avoids solutions that just learn the training data. Popular techniques for regularisation in Supervised Learning include Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression and the Elastic Net. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Assignment, you will be looking at Ridge Regression and devising equations to optimise the objective function in Ridge Regression using two methods: a closed-form derivation and the update rules for stochastic gradient descent. You will then use those update rules for making predictions on a Air Quaility dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ridge Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a data set for training $\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{X}\\}$, where the vector $\\mathbf{y}=[y_1, \\cdots, y_n]^{\\top}$ and $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix from Lab 3, this is, \n",

    "\n",
    "The first term on the right-hand side (rhs) of the expression for $J(\\mathbf{w}, \\alpha)$ is very similar to the least-squares objective function we have seen before, for example in Lab 3. The only difference is on the term $\\frac{1}{n}$ that we use to normalise the objective with respect to the number of observations in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first term on the rhs is what we call the \"fitting\" term whereas the second term in the expression is the regularisation term. Given $\\alpha$, the two terms in the expression have different purposes. The first term is looking for a value of $\\mathbf{w}$ that leads the squared-errors to zero. While doing this, $\\mathbf{w}$ can take any value and lead to a solution that it is only good for the training data but perhaps not for the test data. The second term is regularising the behavior of the first term by driving the $\\mathbf{w}$ towards zero. By doing this, it restricts the possible set of values that $\\mathbf{w}$ might take according to the first term. The value that we use for $\\alpha$ will allow a compromise between a value of $\\mathbf{w}$ that exactly fits the data (first term) or a value of $\\mathbf{w}$ that does not grow too much (second term).\n",
